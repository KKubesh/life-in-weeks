# Life In Weeks React App

I believe how we approach our everyday is based on the perspective
in which you view your life. This chart always interest me because it often felt like a different approach. I recall seeing this chart a while back and I recently pulled it back up. Printed my paper out and started coloring in the squares. I made it about 5 years in and decided I would build this tool myself. Read the original article and get the original chart by [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
